## [Feature] Show addition image information
Make it possible to show additional image information such as:
- filename
- recording date
- original size
- dpi
- camera refactorer & model

## [Feature] Shorten album selection loading time
When many folder have to be scaned for albums, it takes noticable time to open the album selection.
Prevent this by preloading only the first page and loading the other stuff in the background.
